# 🌐 Frontend Development Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of my **frontend mini-projects** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The goal of this repository is to strengthen my **practical frontend development skills** by building real, working projects instead of focusing only on theory.

## 📌 Why I Chose Projects Over Only Learning Concepts

I decided to work on projects first because:

1. **Projects speak louder than certificates**
2. **Real-world practice builds real confidence**
3. Concepts become clear only when they are **used in real applications**
4. Learning everything in one night is not practical
5. This approach prepares me better for **React.js and advanced frameworks**

After completing **15 frontend mini-projects**, I plan to start learning **React.js**, and then return to mastering deeper frontend concepts with stronger clarity.
