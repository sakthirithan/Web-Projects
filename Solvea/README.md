# 🧮 Solvea – Numeric Calculator Web App

**Solvea** is a clean, responsive, and keyboard-enabled **numeric calculator web application** built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.  
It supports basic arithmetic operations with **mouse, keyboard, and optional speech assistance**, making it fast, accessible, and user-friendly.

This project is ideal for **frontend practice**, **college mini projects**, and **portfolio showcasing**.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Calculator buttons are handled using **event listeners**.
2. User input is dynamically appended to the display.
3. Special buttons (`AC`, `DEL`, `=`) are handled with conditional logic.
4. Keyboard events are captured using `keydown`.
5. Mathematical expressions are evaluated dynamically.
6. Speech assistant reads input or full expression based on user action.
