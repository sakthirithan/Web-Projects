## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Calculator buttons are handled using **event listeners**.
2. User input is dynamically appended to the display.
3. Special buttons (`AC`, `DEL`, `=`) are handled with conditional logic.
4. Keyboard events are captured using `keydown`.
5. Mathematical expressions are evaluated dynamically.
